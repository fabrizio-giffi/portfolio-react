        Junior Jobs is a job platform for users to connect with companies - and apply for junior developer positions - and for
        companies to discover new talents to fill their vacancies. The client runs on React while the server and the REST APIs run
        on Express.js. The project has been showcased during the Hackshow on March 29th, 2023 in front of a live audience of 150
        people and has been voted for the best project in the Web Development category.
